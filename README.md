## Repository Structure:
* `example/`: Contains example code snippets for trying out small features. Mostly used for HDL tests, but frontend snippets can go here too.
* `server/`: Contains code for the backend Node.js server. Run the server in this directory using `npm start`.
* `client/`: Contains code for the React frontend. This is in an intermediate stage and will be change drastically as this project progresses.
* `public/`: Deprecated- to be removed
* `lib/`: External HDL library dependencies (mostly Git submodules) are placed here. Frontend dependencies or Node dependencies should be installed using npm in either `server/` or `client/`
